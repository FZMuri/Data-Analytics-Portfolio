This repository is for the projects I have done on Coursera for the Applied Data Science with Python specialization.

This specialization prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.

The specialization is broken down into 5 different courses:

# 1. Introduction to Data Science in Python
## Certificate: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/KRM358DQFDGS
Encompassing the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The project done for this course essentially uses a tabular data, and I was required to clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.

# 2. Applied Plotting, Charting, & Data Representation in Python
This course will introduce the learner to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. I learnt what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. The project for this course 

# 3. Applied Machine Learning in Python
(
<!-- This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis. -->
